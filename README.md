# Managed Implementations
There is the way of building application by specifying algorithm with abstract notions. There should be framework, which would manage actual implementations of given abstractions. You know one of such frameworks - it is Spring. Spring allows user to define the necessary interface and then selects an implementation from the context. Managed Implementations project serves as an abstraction for such a way of development.
